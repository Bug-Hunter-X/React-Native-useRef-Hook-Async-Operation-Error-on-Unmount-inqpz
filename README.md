# React Native useRef Hook Async Operation Error on Unmount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the `useRef` hook and asynchronous operations. The error occurs when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation initiated within the `useRef` hook completes.  The solution shows how to prevent the error by checking the component's mounted status before updating state or props.

## Problem

The `useRef` hook's callback executes even after the component has been unmounted, causing errors because the component's properties or state no longer exist.

## Solution

The best approach is to create a flag that checks if the component is mounted, before attempting to use refs in the callback of the async operation. This prevents attempts to access the ref after unmounting.
