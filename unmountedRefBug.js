This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the asynchronous operation within the `useRef` callback completes.  The callback attempts to update a state or prop of a component that no longer exists, resulting in the error. This is especially problematic with timers or network requests that take longer than the component's lifecycle.
